title: About me
---

I've been working as a software designer and developer engineer in large and medium-sized companies for almost thirty years, focusing mainly on JVM (Quarkus, Java, Spring, Kotlin) and web (Angular) technologies in the last decades.

The craftsman's spirit animates my daily work, quality is not an option and technical excellence matters.

Since the beginning of my career, I have advocated the development of well-designed software as a medium- and long-term investment that combines human and economic benefits by improving the developer's experience and the company's responsiveness to the market.

Collaborative work with domain experts, Event-storming, Specification by example, Domain-driven Design, Test-driven Development, SOLID principles, API design principles, Design patterns, OO and Functional paradigms, Clean, Reactive, distributed architectures, and Actor model, are ingredients I like to use to tackle domain complexity, delight elegant code writing, and apprehend the non-functional aspects of demanding systems.

Coaching, presenting and drawing activities allow me to satisfy my natural need to share knowledge and contribute to the development of IT teams' skills.
