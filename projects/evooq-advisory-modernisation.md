title: Evooq – Advisory modernization
---

February 2022 – March 2023

## Why

Evooq wants to modernize its Advisory product to reduce its internal costs due to a growing number of clients, and reduce the total cost of ownership on the client's side. Moving to a cloud solution should contribute to regain control over a majority of the software components, including delivery frequency and observability. Finally, this is an opportunity to raise the bar in order to offer quality daily deliveries.

## What

* Feature development on an advisory software solution used by investment businesses.
* Modernization of the existing monolithic advisory software solution to a cloud-ready software product.

### Requirements

* To move the current on-premises solution to an hybrid cloud solution.
* To maintain the daily business with the existing clients.

### Challenges

* To contribute to the daily business while doing tactical steps of modernization.
* To design tactical modernization steps for reducing the technical debt.
* To improve the experience of end-users, developers, UX-designers, integrators, and QA-engineers.
* To deal with a growing number of clients while maintaining a standard product.
* To deal with heterogenous clients configurations and with different releasing cycles.

## Organization

* 3 Scrum Teams of 8 software engineers (me) and 1 product owner
* Moving to smaller teams organized around bounded contexts ([Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/), [Inversed Conway's law](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/inverse-conway-maneuver))
