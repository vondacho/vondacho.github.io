title: Lombard Odier â€“ API Ops
---

2024-Q4

## Why
git 
Lombard Odier's technical platform is particularly fragmented, with a large number of micro-services and therefore APIs. Providing visibility of public and internal APIs, as well as design, publishing and integration tools for development teams, is essential to implementing an API-as-a-product culture and contract-first software development.
