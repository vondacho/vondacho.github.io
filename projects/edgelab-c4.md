title: Edgelab â€“ Living Software Architecture Documentation System
---

2020

## Why

To minimize the costs due to the absence of software documentation, especially at the system architecture level, given the complexity of the distributed system in place.

* Cognitive load, on-boarding costs
* Visualization of the distributed architecture
* Distribution of knowledge
* Mental alignment
* On-boarding support
* Communication and collaboration support

## What

To design and develop a software architecture documentation system based on C4 model.

### Requirements

* Living software documentation
* Multi-stakeholder documentation: CEO, CTO, Dev, Ops, Support, PO
* Visual, 3D-navigable, living diagrams, technology agnostic, easy-DSL
* Multi-level architecture documentation
* Source of truth of the documentation seats in the projects and has to be centrally agregated.
* Smooth integration with the development pipeline

## Who

* CEO, CTO, Dev, Ops, Support, PO

## Solution

* Integration of [Structurizr cloud](https://www.structurizr.com/) for 3D visualization
* Integration of Atlassian Confluence cloud for static documentation
* Integration of [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) for static UML documentation
* Distributed documentation based on Structurizr DSL
